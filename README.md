## IFTTT

From Wikipedia:

*[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is a free web-based service to create chains of simple conditional statements, called applets. An applet is triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, or Pinterest.*

IFTTT proposes hundreds of triggers, but the one that Notigo uses is the [Webhook](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) trigger (also known as Maker Event).

By creating an IFTTT applet that send a rich notification to your device when a Webhook is triggered, we can create a simple wrapper that call the specified URL to trigger it from a HTTP call.


## IFTTT account and mobile app

In order to receive a notification from IFTTT, you have to create an IFTTT [account](https://ifttt.com/join) and download the [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635?mt=8) app or the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt&hl=en) app. 


## Creating the IFTTT applet

Next, you need to create the corresponding applet in your IFTTT account. Applets that use Webhook as a trigger can't be share like other applets, so you need to create it manually:

* Go to the applet [creation](https://ifttt.com/create) page;
* Search for `webhook` and select the `Receive a web request` trigger;
* Specify the name of the event (`notigo` is the default one used in the [command example](https://github.com/Scotow/notigo/tree/master/cmd/notigo));
* Click on `Create trigger`;
* For the `that` action, search for `notification` and select the `Send a rich notification from the IFTTT app` action;
* Use the `Add ingredient` button to add `value1` as a title and `value2` as a message. Leave the others blank.

The final configuration of the applet looks like this:

![Applet](applet.png?raw=true)


## Getting the Webhook key

The last step before using the applet is to get your Webhook key. Head to the [Webhook settings page](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) then click on the `Documentation` button on the upper right corner.

Now that you have created the applet and got your Webhook key, you can use the library or the example command.


## Using the library

Here is a simple example that send a notification with "Test" as a title and "Hello from GitHub" as a message:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/scotow/notigo"
)

func main() {
	notification := notigo.NewNotification("Test", "Hello from GitHub")
	key := notigo.Key("eHolJ7y7b8KVk4wUgZS6mY")

	err := key.Send(notification)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Notification sent.")
}
```

You can use the `func (k *Key) SendEvent(n Notification, event string) error` and specify a custom event name if you registered a different one while creating the applet.

Using an empty string as a title or using the `func NewMessage(message string) Notification` function will try to use the hostname of the machine as a title.


## Using the command

This repo has a simple [command](https://github.com/Scotow/notigo/tree/master/cmd/notigo) that allows you to send a notification from your favorite shell.

```
Usage of notigo:

notigo [-k KEY]... [-K PATH]... [-e EVENT] [-t TITLE] [-f PATH]... [-m [-s SEPARATOR]] [-d DELAY] [-c] ARGS...

  -k, --key=KEY                      List of key(s) to use
  -K, --keys-path=PATH               List of file path(s) that contains key(s)
  -e, --event=EVENT                  Event key passed to IFTTT (default: notigo)
  -t, --title=TITLE                  Title of the notification(s)
  -f, --file=PATH                    List of file(s) used for content
  -m, --merge                        Content should be merged
  -s, --merge-separator=SEPARATOR    Separator used while merging content (default: "\n")
  -d, --delay=DELAY                  Delay between two notification (default: 3s)
  -c, --concurrent                   Concurrently send notifications to the keys
```

If no keys is specified using the `-k` or `-K` option, the command will fallback to the  `~/.config/notigo/keys` file if it exists.

The file(s) containing keys (`-K` option or the fallback config file), must contains one key per line.

If no notification content is specified using the `-f` option, the concatenation of the remaining arguments is used. Or, in last resort, the command will read from `STDIN`.

***Enjoy simple notifications!***
